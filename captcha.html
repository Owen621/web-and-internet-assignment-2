                <h3><b>Info about this web page</b></h3>
                <h4><b>How does it work</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>This program is made using only HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
                    <li>It works using the built in Javascript canvas, and the images have been designed by me</li>
                    <li>Event listeners have been written for the buttons and ticking the cells. This then calls the relevant functions</li>
                    <li>The user gets two attempts at passing the CAPTCHA challenge (Although the Reinitialise button allows them to reset it)</li>
                    <li>The program essentially works by using two arrays, one for the array of images to be displayed and one to track which images have been clicked</li>
                    <li>In the image to be displayed array, a 1 represents a snake, 2 a parrot and 3 a frog</li>
                    <li>For every attempt, these numbers are chosen randomly, alongside a further random number to signify the animal to be guessed</li>
                    <li>In the other array, a 1 represents clicked, whereas a 0 represents not been clicked</li>
                    <li>Index 0-4 represents cell 1-5</li>
                    <li>If a new cell is clicked, a tick is drawn in that cell. If a clicked cell is clicked again, a white square is simply drawn over the tick</li>
                    <li>Once the user has won or lost, the canvas is overwritten with a green tick or a red cross</li>
                    <li>These arrays can be compared with the number that should have been ticked, and therefore the result can be calculated ie did the user succeed or fail</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><b>How is this design responsive</b></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The width and height of the canvas are set in HTML, however these are essentially "overwritten" if you like, with a different resolution, in css</li>
                    <li>The width is then set to 80% of the entire page, and the height 20% of the width, in order to create 5 identical squares</li>
                    <li>The images may appear very slightly blurred, and this is because the same 1000 pixels are being used on larger sized canvases</li>
                    <li>However I can proudly say this approach scales perfectly</li>
                    <li>Some slight alterations were required in the Javascript for working out which cell is being ticked but using console.log I was able to figure out how to do it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
